DCC019 - Linguagens de Programação
======

This repository contains the language examples I use in the programming language course.
All of them are based on the material of the Essential of Programming Languages book.

To use these example, you must to clone the project in running the following command
```bash
{
raco pkg install
}
```

Or, alternativly, you can open the DrRacket in install the coolectioon using the DrRacket's Package Manager.
